# Python Lisp

> This project is (__heavily__) based on the course made in the University of Chile, [link](https://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~etanter/CC5116/) follow the link to learn some of the decisions implementing this compiler and to see what this project it's about

The idea of this project is to recreate the compiler and interpreter made on ocaml and racket in python. Just as a personal challenge
- The project for parsing uses lark for parsing the s-expressions
- The runtime is based in C, currently deciding the calling convention.
